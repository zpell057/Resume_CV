					<p id="gngDesc" class="leftContainer">GNG 1503 is a first-year class where students cooperate in teams of 4 to 6 to create a solution for a real-life client. <br>When I took the class in the fall semester of 2023, my team and I had to create a solution to accurately and efficiently determine the dimensions of roller bearings put in front of a camera. The solution had to be simple to use and cheap. <br>Because I was the only student in our team who knew how to code, I had the responsibility of creating a program that would determine the size of a roller bearing and automatically find which bearing was being measured. <br>I developed this program in Python using OpenCV to detect the shapes of the bearing and compare their sizes to a square of known dimensions. Using Pandas, the program then efficiently sorted through the catalog of bearings of the client and returned the products which were closest to the measurements. The right bearings were usually in the first ten bearings returned by the program, depending on the quality of the pictures of the bearings.<br>In the final competition on design day, our solution was judged as the second best in our category.</p>

I built, among other things, the gearbox that spun the magnetic rotor that induced the current.<br>We then rectified and normalised the current to make it DC with an electric circuit.<br>After a lot of optimisations, we were able to induce 3.2 volts DC from the rectified output of our three coils.</p>

The club also served as experience on collaborative work among a team of different people who work towards a common goal.</p>
